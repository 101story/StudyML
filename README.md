Machine Learning Study
===================

* Basic Math Theory

* Jump to Python
    - Python Basic

* Deep Learning Zero To All
    - https://hunkim.github.io/ml/

* Data Science School
    - https://datascienceschool.net/view-notebook/661128713b654edc928ecb455a826b1d/

* Deep Learning from Scratch
    - We do not rely on libraries or frameworks, we create the core of deep learning from the bottom up.

* Python for Data Analysis
    - Python for Data Analysis is concerned with the nuts and bolts of manipulating, processing, cleaning, and crunching data in Python. 
    - It is also a practical, modern introduction to scientific computing in Python, tailored for data-intensive applications.

* Hands Machine Learning Scikit Learn TensorFlow
    - Explore the machine learning landscape, particularly neural nets
    - Use scikit-learn to track an example machine-learning project end-to-end
    - Explore several training models, including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methods
    - Use the TensorFlow library to build and train neural nets
    - Dive into neural net architectures, including convolutional nets, recurrent nets, and deep reinforcement learning
    - Learn techniques for training and scaling deep neural nets
    - Apply practical code examples without acquiring excessive machine learning theory or algorithm details

* Machine Learning in Action
    - Tatistical data processing, data analysis, and data visualization in code. 
    - Tactical tasks like classification, forecasting, recommendations, and higher-level features like summarization and simplification.

* Machine Learning for the Web
    - Get familiar with the fundamental concepts and some of the jargons used in the machine learning community
    - Use tools and techniques to mine data from websites
    - Grasp the core concepts of Django framework
    - Get to know the most useful clustering and classification techniques and implement them in Python
    - Acquire all the necessary knowledge to build a web application with Django
    - Successfully build and deploy a movie recommendation system application using the Django framework in Python    

* Web Scraping with Python
